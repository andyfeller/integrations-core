    # to the instance that will be added to all the metrics of this check instance.

    # use_histogram controls whether we send detailed metrics, i.e. one per container.
    # When false, we send detailed metrics corresponding to individual
    # containers, tagging by container id to keep them unique.
    # When true, we aggregate data based on container image.
    # Defaults to false
